## Background

AutosRU's has developed a new prototoype, the MechaCar and has requested a review of the production data for insights that may assist the manufacturing team in it's process.
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Results are:

![Summary LinRegmpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89953246/146079129-9f7df7b5-557a-4279-bf13-00ac1c4368e5.png)
 1.  The regression model identifies vehicle length and ground clearance provides a non-random amount of variance based on the PR(>T)  to the mpg values in the dataset.
 2.  The slope of the linear mode is not zero, there are two variables that are considered significant and affects mpg.
 3.  The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively based on the R-sqaure of 0.71
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
